In this project, H.R data of a company is used to understand and predict employee turnover. 

First, several different EDA techniques are used to gain meaningful insights out of the data and understand the important parameters which can be used for prediction. 

SMOTE sampling technique is used to sample the data. Using the sampled data, different machine learning algorithms have been applied. 

Logistic regression, SVM, Random forests and Gradient Boosting were all applied to the sampled data and based on AUC, the performance of these algorithms were evaluated. 

The dataset for this project is taken from Kaggle.com, however it is no longer available but I have put the dataset. This repository is based on the work of Randy Lao, I've modified and added EDA and machine learning techniques.
